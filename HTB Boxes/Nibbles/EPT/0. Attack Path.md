The Initial Foothold started by enumerating the web application, which led to the discovery of the `nibbleblog` app being deployed, after further enumeration, an admin login portal was discovered.
The admin login portal was vulnerable to a weak credentials choice, which led to our access over the web application.
We further enumerated the web application to discover it's `version 4.0.3` which is vulnerable to arbitary file upload.
We uploaded a webshell that will allow us to execute commands over the web app on the server.
